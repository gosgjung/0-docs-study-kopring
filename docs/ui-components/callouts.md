# Callouts
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

Markdown does not include support for callouts. However, you can style text as a callout using a Markdown extension supported by kramdown: [*block IALs*](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#block-attributes).

Common kinds of callouts include `highlight`, `important`, `new`, `note`, and `warning`.

{: .warning }
These callout names are *not* pre-defined by the theme: you need to define your own names.
